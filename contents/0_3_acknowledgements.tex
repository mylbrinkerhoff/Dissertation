\begin{acknowledgements}
    Acknowledgements in dissertations and theses are always so awkward and sometimes difficult to write. This is because there are no words that can adequately express the gratitude that you feel towards those who have helped you along the way. But I will try my best.
    
    I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Grant McGuire, for his guidance and support throughout my time at the graduate program at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Thanks to him, I have learned and grown as a researcher and as a person. Thanks to his guidance, encouragement, and support, I have been able to complete this dissertation. 

    This dissertation would also not have been possible without the help of my committee members, Professors Jaye Padgett, Ryan Bennett, and Marc Garellek. Their feedback and advice have been invaluable in shaping my research and my writing. Thank you for your time and effort in reading my dissertation and for your thoughtful comments. I am grateful for your support and encouragement. 

    Besides my committee members, I would like to also thank the first linguistic Banana slugs I had the pleasure of knowing. Abby and Aaron Kaplan, both alumni from the linguistic program here at UC Santa Cruz, introduced me to the world of phonetics and phonology while I was an undergraduate student at the University of Utah and by their own love of the field, they inspired me to pursue a career in linguistics. I am grateful for their support while an undergraduate and for helping me take the first steps in my career as a linguist.


    


    Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Betsy, and my daughter, Maelyn, for their patience and understanding. I could not have done this without them. Without their love and support, I would not have been able to complete this dissertation.
