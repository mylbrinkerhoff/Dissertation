\section{What is Laryngeal Complexity?}\label{sec:what_is_lc}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Laryngeal complexity is defined as the contrastive use of tone and phonation on the same syllablic nucleus \citep{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997}. This use of both tone and phonation on the same nucleus is one of the defining characteristics of the Oto-Manguean languages \citep{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}. However, it is not limited to just these languages. It has also been used to describe the behavior of tone or pitch in languages outside of the Oto-Manguean languages; such as the Tibeto-Burman languages of Mpi and Tamang \citep{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997} and the Mayan language Yucatec Mayan \citep{frazierPhoneticsYucatecMaya2013}. 
%, and the Germanic language Danish \citep{frazierPhoneticsYucatecMaya2013,penaStodTimingDomain2022,penaProductionPerceptionStod2024}.

\subsection{Phasing and recoverability}\label{sec:phasing_and_recoverability}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

According to \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997}, one of the defining aspects of laryngeal complexity is the concept of phasing and recoverability. Under this idea, in laryngeally complex vowels the phonation and tone are phased with respect to one another in way that lends itself to a listener's ability to recover the underlying phonation and tone. In practical terms this means that laryngeally complex vowels are composed of two components: a modal voice portion of the vowel where tone is realized, and a non-modal voice portion of the vowel where phonation is realized. For the researcher that means that there are two distinct portions of the vowel that can be analyzed separately and that need to be analyzed temporally rather than spectrally \citep[237]{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}.

For example, in the Oto-Manguean language Jalapa Mazatec, breathiness or creakiness is realized only on the first portion of the vowel either as full laryngeal consonant or as a laryngeal feature on the vowel \citep[238]{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}. The second portion of the vowel is realized as a modal voice vowel with one of the three tones belonging to the tonemes of the language. This means that the breathiness or creakiness is phased with respect to the tone.

\citeauthor{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} argues that there are three principles that help explain why laryngeal complexity needs to be temporally ordered or phased: (i) sufficient acoustic distance, (ii) sufficient articulatory compatibility, and (iii) optimal auditory salience. 

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Sufficient acoustic distance}\label{sec:sufficient_acoustic_distance}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

\citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} argues that sufficient acoustic distance is necessary for the recoverability of the phonation and tone. As Silverman explain, listeners do not rely on the fundamental frequency alone to perceive pitch. Instead, listeners use the harmonic spacing and the pulse period in the signal to perceive pitch \citep{ritsmaFrequenciesDominantPerception1967,remezIntonationSinusoidalSentences1993}. For modal phonation, this means that the harmonic spacing and pulse periods are present and encode a salient pitch value. However, during non-modal phonation, the harmonic spacing and pulse periods are often obscured or not present.

For breathy voice, this means that there is a general weakening 
of the harmonic structure which makes it difficult to recover the pitch by the listener \citep{silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997}. Creaky voice on the other had obscures the pulse periods due to its aperiodic and unstable glottal vibration \citep{ladefogedSoundsWorldLanguages1996}. This is what was observed in Mazatec where the harmonic structure is gone and the pulses are indiscernible \citep{kirkQuantifyingAcousticProperties1993}. Additionally, the perception of pitch is rendered indiscernible when the pulse periods are varied by 10\% or more \citep{rosenbergPitchDiscriminationJittered1966}.

These observations lead \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} to conclude that if a period glottal wave is either obscured (as with breathy voice) or not present (as with creaky voice), the acoustic signal cannot encode a salient pitch value. This means that the phonation and tone must be phased with respect to one another in order for the listener to recover the underlying phonation and tone. I will return to this point in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_of_lc}.

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Sufficient articulatory compatibility}\label{sec:sufficient_articulatory_compatibility}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another important point for the \citeauthor{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}'s theory about laryngeal complexity has to deal with the articulatory compatibility of the phonation and tone. One of the guiding ideas behind this principle is that there is a principle of least effort in biological motor systems such as with speech production \citep{lindblomEconomySpeechGestures1983}. According to \citet{lindblomEconomySpeechGestures1983}, speech gestures can be thought of as distinct motor goals in our speech production system. These goals are achieved by the speaker through the coordination of the articulators with the least amount of effort. This means that that the gestures are coordinated in such a way that they are compatible with one another. This manifests itself either through sequencing or coarticulation of the gestures.

A good example of this comes from nasalization. In nasal contexts, the velum is lowered to allow air to pass through the nasal cavity, creating a nasal sound. This velum lowering gesture is compatible with the gestures needed in the oral cavity to produce different vowel qualities. This is what leads to the production of nasal vowels in languages like French or Portuguese. Additionally, this lowering also occurs in languages that do not have contrastive nasal vowels, such as English, where the velum is lowered in anticipation of a nasal consonant. This lowering of the velum is compatible with the gestures needed to produce the vowels in the oral cavity \citep[e.g.,][]{ohalaPhoneticExplanationsNasal1975,chenAcousticCorrelatesEnglish1997,stylerAcousticalPerceptualFeatures2015}.

According to \citeauthor{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}'s theory of laryngeal complexity, this idea of articulatory compatibility is also driving the need to phase phonation and tone. In the case of laryngeal complexity this is because it is assumed that both tone and phonation are produced by the larynx, more specifically the vocal folds and the glottis. This comes from early work on phonation and tone. For tone, \citet{ohalaProductionTone11978} showed that pitch was controlled primarily by the tensing or laxing of the vocal folds which changed the rate at which the vocal folds vibrate. For phonation, it was similarly shown that the amount the vocal folds where held open or closed determined the type of phonation that was produced \citep{ladefogedSoundsWorldLanguages1996}. This aspect of phonation was shown in Figure~\ref{fig:phonation_types} and repeated here as Figure~\ref{fig:phonation_types_repeat}.

\end{figure}

For \citeauthor{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}'s \citeyear{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} theory of laryngeal complexity, the articulatory mechanisms for tone and phonation are exactly the same which leads to a need to phase the two in order to optimally make use of the same articulatory gestures. However, there is a growing body of literature that shows that tone and phonation is much more complex and is reliant on the entire larynx not just the vocal folds (e.g., \cite{eslingVoiceQualityLaryngeal2019}). This matter will be picked up again in Section~\ref{sec:discussion_of_lc} and Chapter~\ref{ch:modeling_lc}.

\subsection{Implicational hierarchy of laryngealization}\label{sec:implicational_hierarchy}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another aspect of \citeauthor{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}'s \citeyear{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} laryngeal complexity theory is that there is an implicational hierarchy in the phasing and ordering of phonation and tone. This hierarchy is based on how laryngealization appears in three Oto-Manguean languages. In this implicational hierarchy laryngealization can only appear in three ways: prevocalic, postvocalic, or interrupted. In the prevocalic case, the laryngealization appears before the vowel. In the postvocalic case, the laryngealization appears after the vowel. In the interrupted case, the laryngealization interrupts a vowel and appears in the middle.

According to \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}, if a language has interrupted laryngealization, it must also have postvocalic laryngealization. If a language has postvocalic laryngealization, it must also have prevocalic laryngealization. In support of his claims \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} provides data from three Oto-Manguean languages: Jalapa Mazatec, Comaltepec Chinantec, and Copala Trique. These languages are shown in Table~\ref{tab:implicational_hierarchy}.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \caption{Implicational hierarchy of laryngeal complexity. The symbols h and Ê” represent laryngealization. The symbol V represents where the modal vowel is located in relation to the laryngealization.  Modified from \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997}.} 
    \label{tab:implicational_hierarchy}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
        \lsptoprule
        \textbf{Language} & \textbf{Prevocalic} & \textbf{Postvocalic} & \textbf{Interrupted} \\
        \hline 
        Jalapa Mazatec & hVË¥, Ê”VË¥ & $-$ & $-$ \\
        Comaltepec Chinantec & hVË¥, Ê”VË¥ & VhË¥, VÊ”Ë¥ & $-$ \\
        Copala Trique & hVË¥, Ê”VË¥ & VhË¥, VÊ”Ë¥ & VhVË¥, VÊ”VË¥ \\
        \lspbottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

However, as mentioned by \citet{frazierPhoneticsYucatecMaya2013}, it is not clear how accurate or robust this implicational hierarchy is. The reason for this is because it is not always clear if something is a laryngeal consonant or a laryngeal feature on the vowel. Indeed, \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997} treats laryngeal consonants and laryngeal features on vowels as the same thing. For example, in many of the Trique languages, the laryngealization is realized as a laryngeal consonant \citep{dicanioPhoneticsPhonologySan2008,dicanioItunyosoTrique2010,dicanioCoarticulationToneGlottal2012,dicanioPhoneticsFortisLenis2012,dicanioCueWeightPerception2014,dicanioGlottalTogglingItunyoso2020,elliottChicahuaxtlaTriqui2016,hollenbachPhonologyMorphologyTone1984}, but in Jalapa Mazatec, the laryngealization is realized as a laryngeal feature on the vowel \citep{kirkQuantifyingAcousticProperties1993,garellekAcousticConsequencesPhonation2011}. 

Another issue with the implicational hierarchy is that it is based on only three languages. This is a rather small sample size and doesn't capture the full range of variation in the Oto-Manguean languages. For example, in many Mixtec languages, laryngealization is understood to be a feature of the vowel rather than a consonant \citep[e.g.,][]{cortesSanSebastianMonte2023,eischensTonePhonationPhonologyPhonetics2022,gerfenPhonologyPhoneticsCoatzospan1999,gerfenProductionPerceptionLaryngealized2005}. Additionally, in many of this languages, the larngealization can appear either in the middle of the vowel, what \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997} calls interrupted, or at the end of the vowel \citep[e.g.,][]{cortesSanSebastianMonte2023,eischensTonePhonationPhonologyPhonetics2022}. This is directly in contrast to the implicational hierarchy which states that if a language has interrupted laryngealization, it must also have postvocalic laryngealization and prevocalic laryngealization.

Not only is the violation of the implicational hierarchy the case in Mixtecan languages, it is also the case in other branches of the Oto-Manguean languages. It is often the case that Zapotec languages only have interrupted and postvocalic vowels or just interrupted vowels (see \cite{ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018} for a typology of phonation in Zapotec languages).  

For example, \citet{avelinobecerraTopicsYalalagZapotec2004,avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010} argues that YalÃ¡lag Zapotec only has interrupted laryngealization as a vowel feature and postvocalic laryngealization with a laryngeal consonant.
