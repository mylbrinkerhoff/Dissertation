\begin{acknowledgements}
    When it comes to acknowledgements, there are so many words that could be said, but they often feel awkward and do not actually . There are many people who have helped me along the way, from my family to my friends, to my colleagues and mentors. I am grateful to all of them. 

    % I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Grant McGuire, for his guidance and support throughout my time in graduate school. I would also like to thank my committee members, Professor Jaye Padgett, Professor Ryan Bennett, and Professor Marc Garellek, for their feedback and advice.

    % I would like to thank my family for their love and support. I would also like to thank my friends for their encouragement and understanding.

    % Finally, I would like to thank my wife, Betsy for their patience and understanding. I could not have done this without them.
