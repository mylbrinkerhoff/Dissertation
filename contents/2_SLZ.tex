\section{Introduction} \label{sec:SLZ-intro}
%-------------------------

Santiago Laxopa Zapotec (SLZ; \textit{Dille'xhunh Laxup} [di˨ʒeˀ˨ʐun˨ lːa˨ʂupʰ˦]) is a Northern Zapotec language spoken by approximately 1000 people in the municipality of Santiago Laxopa, Ixtlán,Oaxaca, Mexico and in diaspora communities throughout Mexico and the United States \citep{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016,adlerDerivationVerbInitiality2018,foleyForbiddenCliticClusters2018,foleyExtendingPersonCaseConstraint2022}. 
According to \citet{smith-starkAlgunasIsoglosasZapotecas2007}, SLZ is part of the macro variety of Cajonos Zapotec, which also includes Zoogocho Zapotec, Yatzachi Zapotec, Yalálag Zapotec, Tabaá Zapotec, Lachirioag Zapotec, and several other varieties spoken in the Sierra Norte of Oaxaca, Mexico.

\section{Vowels in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec} \label{sec:SLZ-vowels}
%-------------------------

SLZ exhibits a four-vowel inventory; see Table~\ref{tab:SLZ_vowel_chart}. This type of vowel inventory is very common among Sierra Norte Zapotecs. Most varieties have the vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, and /o/ \citep{nellisFortisLenisCajonos1980,jaegerInitialConsonantClusters1982,butlerh.DiccionarioZapotecoYatzachi1997,avelinoTopicsYalalagZapotec2004,longDiccionarioZapotecoSan2005,sonnenscheinDescriptiveGrammarSan2005}. 

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Vowel qualities in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec.}
    \label{tab:SLZ_vowel_chart}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
        \lsptoprule
        &  front& central  & back \\
        \midrule 
        high   	&  i  &     &   u$\thicksim$o \\
        mid    	&  e  &   	& 	\\
        low   	&     &  a 	&	  \\
        \lspbottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The vowel /o/ is marginal in SLZ's lexicon, only appearing in a few lexical items such as the diminutive classifier \textit{do'}. Instead, this vowel is replaced by /u/ in most cases. However, this difference is not universal among all speakers in the community. For the most part older speakers exhibit the vowel /o/ in their speech, while younger speakers tend to replace it with /u/. Most speakers, when asked, classify the two back rounded vowels as the same phoneme and view them as a dialectal feature between the different pueblos. For example, in neighboring San Bartolomé Zoogocho the /u/ vowel is very marginal and has led \citet{sonnenscheinDescriptiveGrammarSan2005} to describe the language as having only four vowels.It is interesting to note that everywhere that SLZ has the vowels /u/ or /o/, Zoogocho only has /o/. Further evidence for this comes from plotting the vowels along the first two formants. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SLZvowels}, the vowels /o/ and /u/ occupy nearly identical vowel spaces.

	\label{fig:slz_vowels}
\end{figure}

Additional evidence for the overlap of /o/ and /u/ can be measured with a combination of Pillai scores \citep{pillaiNewTestCriteria1955,hayFactorsInfluencingSpeech2006,nyczBestPracticesMeasuring2014} and Bhattarcharyya's Affinity \citep{bhattacharyyaMeasureDivergenceTwo1943,johnsonQuantifyingOverlapBhattacharyyas2015,warrenQualityQuantityNew2018,strellufChapter3Low2018}. Both of these measures show what degree of overlap exists between two different items in some space. Their use in linguistics has been used mainly to show the process of complete and partial mergers between vowels, such as the \textsc{near-square} vowel merger in New Zealand English \citep{hayFactorsInfluencingSpeech2006}. The Pillai scores and Bhattacharyya's Affinity show that the vowels /o/ and /u/ are nearly identical in their vowel space; see Table~\ref{tab:SLZvowels_affinity}.

\begin{table}[h!]
    \centering
    \caption{Pillai scores and Bhattacharyya's Affinity for /o/ and /u/ in SLZ.}
    \label{tab:SLZvowels_affinity}
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
        \lsptoprule
        &  Pillai score & Bhattacharyya's Affinity \\
        \midrule
        All speakers & 0.157 & 0.892 \\
        Females & 0.138 & 0.890 \\
        Males   & 0.224 & 0.858 \\
        \lspbottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In interpreting these results, Pillai scores range from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating overlap and 1 indicating complete no overlap. Bhattacharyya's Affinity ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating no overlap and 1 indicating complete overlap. The results show that the overlap between /o/ and /u/ is not complete, but it is also not completely separating. This is consistent with the observations made by myself and other researchers for this variety (Toosarvandani, p.c.). 

In summary, we can conclude that SLZ is similar to other Northern Zapotec varieties in having a four-vowel inventory. The vowel /o/ is marginal in the lexicon and is often replaced by /u/ in younger speakers. The vowels /o/ and /u/ occupy nearly identical vowel spaces, and the overlap between the two vowels is not complete but is also not completely separating.

\section{Phonation in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec} \label{sec:SLZ-voicequality}
%-------------------------

One of the defining characteristics of the Oto-Manguean languages is their use of contrastive phonation \citep{campbellOtomangueanHistoricalLinguistics2017,campbellOtomangueanHistoricalLinguistics2017a}. This fact is so common and widespread that it is has been reconstructed for the proto-language (see \cite{renschComparativeOtomangueanPhonology1976}). Additionally, the use of contrastive phonation in Oto-Manguaean languages led \citet{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,silvermanPhasingRecoverability1997} to create the term \textit{laryngeal complexity} to describe how phonation is realized in these languages and the development of theories of how phonation interacts with tone. 

This use of contrastive phonation is prevalent in the Zapotec languages (see \cite{ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018} for an overview and typology of the phonation contrasts in the Zapotec language family), with SLZ being no exception. SLZ
has a four-way voice quality contrast: modal, breathy, and two types of laryngealization which are checked and rearticulated. These contrasts are exemplified in the near-minimal quadruple in (\ref{ex:SLZphonation}).

\ea \label{ex:SLZphonation} Four-way near minimal phonation contrast
    \ea \textit{yag}   [çax˨] `tree; wood; \textit{almúd} (unit of measurement  $\thicksim$4kg)'
    \ex \textit{yah}   [ça̤˨] `metal; rifle; bell'
    \ex \textit{cha'}  [tʃaˀ˨]  `cooking pot'
    \ex \textit{ya'a}  [çaˀa˨] `market'
    \z
\z

In representing the checked and rearticulated vowels, I follow \citet{avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010, uchiharaToneRegistrogenesisQuiavini2016} in representing laryngealization as a superscript glottal stop in the IPA transcriptions (i.e., [aˀ] or [aˀa]). This allows for a standardized way to discuss these phonations without referencing their variable pronunciation, see Sections~\ref{sec:SLZ-voicequality-checked} and ~\ref{sec:SLZ-voicequality-rearticulated} for a more detailed discussion of checked and rearticulated phonations respectively. 

%------------------------
\subsection{Breathy vowels in SLZ} \label{sec:SLZ-voicequality-breathy}
%------------------------
SLZ is also unique in regards to its voice quality contrasts because it is a Northern Core Zapotec that has developed breathy voice, which has not been described in any of the neighboring Sierra Norte varieties \citep{nellisFortisLenisCajonos1980,jaegerInitialConsonantClusters1982,butlerh.DiccionarioZapotecoYatzachi1997,avelinoTopicsYalalagZapotec2004,sonnenscheinDescriptiveGrammarSan2005,longDiccionarioZapotecoSan2005}. However, breathy voice does appear in other Zapotec languages most frequently in Central Valley Zapotecs \citep{munroDicsyonaaryTeenDiizh1999,espositoSantaAnaValle2004,espositoVariationContrastivePhonation2010,uchiharaToneRegistrogenesisQuiavini2016,ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018}. Breathy voice is characterized by aperiodicity in the harmonic structure of throughout the vowel or a portion thereof depending on the speaker. 

An example of breathy voice is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:BreathyVowel}, which is the spectrogram and waveform for the word \textit{yah} [ça̤˨]`metal; rifle; bell' produced by a female speaker in their 50s. In this figure, we see that the breathy voice on the vowel shows a large amount of noise as evidenced by the aperiodicity in the waveform and the haziness seen in the spectrogram.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/Spectrograms/yah.png}
    \caption{Breathy vowel in the word \textit{yah} `metal; rifle'}
    \label{fig:BreathyVowel}
\end{figure}

As will be discussed in Chapters~\ref{ch:revealing_trees} and \ref{ch:testing_lc}, breathy voice is also characterized as having a longer duration than modal voice and having a lower fundamental frequency (\textit{f}0) than the other phonation types with the same tone. This behavior is consistent with the behavior of breathy voice in other languages \citep[e.g.,][]{blankenshipTimeCourseBreathiness1997,brunelleDialectExperiencePerceptual2012,brunelleTonePhonationSoutheast2016,hillenbrandAcousticCorrelatesBreathy1996}.

%------------------------
\subsection{Checked vowels in SLZ} \label{sec:SLZ-voicequality-checked}
%------------------------
SLZ shares with other Zapotec variates two types of laryngealization: checked and rearticulated. These two types of laryngealization are characterized by the presence of a glottal occlusion or some form of creaky voice that is produced in a portion of the vowel. Checked vowels are typically produced with a glottal stop at the end of the vowel (i.e., /aʔ/) or a period of creakiness at the end of the vowel (i.e., /aa̰/). 

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:CheckedVowel}, which was produced by a male speaker in his mid-twenties, the checked vowel in the word \textit{yu'} [çuˀ˨] `earth' is characterized by a rapid decrease in amplitude and aperiodicity at the end of the vowel. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{images/Spectrograms/RD_yu'.png}
    \caption{Checked vowel in the word \textit{yu'} `earth'}
    \label{fig:CheckedVowel}
\end{figure}

As will be discussed in Chapters~\ref{ch:revealing_trees} and \ref{ch:testing_lc}, checked vowels are also characterized as having a longer duration than modal voice and the second half of the vowel is characterized as having a decrease in voicing amplitude and the presence of creaky voice.
%------------------------
\subsection{Rearticulated vowels in SLZ} \label{sec:SLZ-voicequality-rearticulated}
%------------------------
Rearticulated vowels are the term used by Oto-Mangueanists to describe the class of laryngealized vowels which have a glottal occlusion or some sort of glottalization in the middle of the vowel \citep{ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018} and are distinct from other uses of the term such as rearticulated vowels in Mayan languages \citep{bairdPhoneticPhonologicalRealizations2011}. Linguists have also used other terms such as interrupted, laryngealized, broken, creaky, et cetera \citep{adlerAcousticsPhonationTypes2016,ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018,avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010,longDiccionarioZapotecoSan2005,sonnenscheinDescriptiveGrammarSan2005}. I will be using the term rearticulated to refer to these vowels throughout the dissertation.

These vowels are also highly variable in their production, hence the large number of terms used to refer to these vowels. For some speakers, they are produced with a full glottal stop in the middle of the vowel (i.e., /aʔa/), while others produce a vowel with apparent modal voice but with a drop in amplitude (similar to what \cite{gerfenProductionPerceptionLaryngealized2005} found for some Mixtec varieties), while others produce a creaky voice throughout the entire vowel. Some speakers produce a combination of these unique productions. This is also consistent with the findings of \citet{avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010} who found that the rearticulated vowels in Yalálag Zapotec had at least four different pronunciations among his consultants, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:yalalag_laryngeal}. 

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\caption{Layngealized Vowels in Yalálag Zapotec}
	\label{tab:yalalag_laryngeal}
	 \begin{tabular}{ll}
	\lsptoprule
	/VˀV/	&  [VʔV]  \\
			&  [VV̰V]   \\
			&  [VV̰ːV̆]  \\
			&  [VV̰V̰]	\\
	\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figures~\ref{fig:FSRLaryngeal} and ~\ref{fig:RDLaryngeal} show how two different speakers produce these vowels. Figure~\ref{fig:FSRLaryngeal} shows how a female speaker in her 50s produces this vowel. Figure~\ref{fig:FSRza'a} shows the rearticulated vowel in the word \textit{za'a} [zaˀa˨˥] `corncob'. In this spectrogram and waveform FSR produces a modal vowel that is clearly divided by a glottal stop. This is the typical pronunciation used by this speaker. However, when the rearticulated vowel cooccurs with a low tone, like in the word \textit{xa'ag} [ʂaˀax˨] `topil', FSR produces the vowel with creaky voice, as seen in the spectrogram in Figure~\ref{fig:FSRxa'ag}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/Spectrograms/za'a.png}

	\caption{FSR's rearticulated vowels in \textit{za'a} `corncob' and \textit{xa'ag} `topil'}
	\label{fig:FSRLaryngeal}
\end{figure}

However, RD, a male in their mid-20s, produces the rearticulated vowels consistently with creaky voice. This is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:RDza'a} and ~\ref{fig:RDxa'ag} which are the same words as found in Figure~\ref{fig:FSRLaryngeal}. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{subfigure}{.5\textwidth}

	\caption{RD's rearticulated vowels in \textit{za'a} `corncob' and \textit{xa'ag} `topil'}
	\label{fig:RDLaryngeal}
\end{figure}

As will be discussed in Chapters~\ref{ch:revealing_trees} and \ref{ch:testing_lc}, rearticulated vowels are also characterized as having a longer duration than modal voice and the first half of the vowel is characterized as having a decrease in voicing amplitude and the presence of creaky voice.

% \subsection{Laryngealization's status in Zapotec languages} \label{sec:laryngeal_status}
% %-------------------------

% The status of laryngealization in Zapotec languages has been a topic of some debate. \citet{avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010,espositoSantaAnaValle2004} have argued that checked vowels are not actually a unique phonation type but involve a glottal stop consonant because most realizations of these vowels involve a complete glottal closure. This is similar to the arguments made by \citet{dicanioCoarticulationToneGlottal2012,dicanioCueWeightPerception2014} for why the laryngeals in Trique are not a phonation type but rather a consonant. 

% However, much work has shown that this cannot be true in Zapotec for the laryngealized vowels, which have a glottal closure in their center. \citet{chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010} summarizes this work and offers six reasons why these ``glottal stops" are a vocalic feature, not a consonant in laryngealized vowels. The first reason has to do with the distribution of the glottal stop. If it is indeed a coda or onset, then we would expect it could also occur word-initially or in consonant clusters. This does not happen in SLZ or other Zapotec languages \citep{jaegerInitialConsonantClusters1982}. Another point that he raises is that when linguists ask native language consultants about how many syllables or beats the word has, they treat laryngealized vowels as if they only had a single beat.\footnote{This is something Maya Wax Cavallaro and I tested with one of our consultants. The only times they said one of these laryngealized vowels was not a single beat was when they had different vowel qualities on either side of the glottal closure (e.g., \textit{bi'a} [biˀa] `fly (insect)').} These and other points raised by \citeauthor{chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010} are presented in (\ref{ex:chavez}). 

% \ea  Summary: glottal stop as a vocalic feature in laryngealized vowels (adapted from \cite{chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010}). \label{ex:chavez}
%     \ea /ʔ/ defective distribution (not in onset, not in clusters)
%     \ex Larynealized vowels have the same tonal sequences as single vowels
%     \ex Monosyllabic tendency of the majority of languages (roots = 1σ)
%     \ex *VʔC\sub{fortis}, predicted by bimoraicity of laryngealized vowels
%     \ex Same vowel quality, i.e., one vowel gesture (diphthongs a minority)
%     \ex Perceived as single syllables by native speakers (ʔ ≠ sufficient consonantal barrier, i.e., syllable boundary)
%     \z 
% \z 

% One point that he does not mention is that if we assume the glottal stop is a coda consonant, then we would also expect to see the other phonation types being able to cooccur with this coda consonant. Much work still needs to be done from a phonological perspective. Treating /ʔ/ and /h/ as a vocalic feature or as a consonant is worth further study, but in the present work I assume that these sounds are vocal characteristics and contribute to the phonation contrasts following the traditional interpretation of these sounds.

\section{Tonal contrasts in Santiago Laxopa Zapotec} \label{sec:SLZ-tones}
%-------------------------
One of the most well known features of all Oto-Manguean languages is the fact that they are tonal languages and exhibit a large range of tonal systems \citep{pikeProblemsZapotecTone1948,renschComparativeOtomangueanPhonology1976,josserandMixtecDialectHistory1983,silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,beamdeazconaProblemsZapotecTone2007,dicanioItunyosoTrique2010,dicanioCoarticulationToneGlottal2012,elliottChicahuaxtlaTriqui2016,campbellOtomangueanHistoricalLinguistics2017,campbellOtomangueanHistoricalLinguistics2017a,lillehaugenOtomangueanLanguages2019,eischensTonePhonationPhonologyPhonetics2022}. SLZ has a five-way tonal contrast which consists of three level tones (high, mid, low) and two contour tones (rising and falling). 

\begin{table}[!h]
	\centering
	\caption{Examples of the five tonal patterns observed in the Santiago Laxopa Zapotec monosyllables.}
	\label{tab:tones}
	\begin{tabular}{llll}

	Low   	 &  \textit{yu'} 	& [ çuˀ˨ ] & `earth'\\
	Rising	 &  \textit{yu'u} 	& [ çuˀu˧˦ ] & `quicklime (Sp. cal)' \\
	Falling  &  \textit{yu'u}  &  [ çuˀu˦˨ ] &	`house' \\
	\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% \end{figure}

Following discussion from \citet{brinkerhoffTonalPatternsTheir2022} these tones appear to be limited in their distribution. It is true that all five patterns can surface on a syllable but there is a restriction in what tonal patterns are allowed to surface on words that are larger than bimoraic. The patterns that we observe on bimoraic nominals are: HL, MH, and LL.

\section{Interactions between tone and voice quality} \label{sec:SLZ-interaction}
%------------------------------------

Most previous work on the interaction of tone and phonation has been focused on the languages of East and Southeast Asia (e.g., \cite{masicaDefiningLinguisticArea1976,thurgoodVietnameseTonogenesisRevising2002,yipTone2002,enfieldArealLinguisticsMainland2005,michaudComplexTonesEast2012,brunelleTonePhonationSoutheast2016}). What has been found in these descriptions is that certain tones and phonations are codependent. For example, \citet{smalleyProblemsConsonantsTone1976} and \citet{ratliffMeaningfulToneStudy1992} both describe White Hmong's \textit{-g} tone as being a mid-low tone with breathy phonation, and Mandarin's tone 3 is often associated with creaky phonation \citep{hockettPeipingPhonology1947}. \citet{brunelleTonePerceptionNorthern2009} found that creaky phonation plays an important role in producing certain tones. Additionally, work on S'gaw Karen has found that two tones are only differentiated by some form of non-modal phonation (Boehm p.c.). 

However, there have been some observations–especially in Mesoamerica–that tone and phonation are independent of each other \citep[e.g.,][]{silvermanLaryngealComplexityOtomanguean1997,garellekAcousticConsequencesPhonation2011}. This means that tone can independently occur with any phonation type. This has also been extensively described in multiple Zapotecan languages \citep[e.g.,][]{,avelinoTopicsYalalagZapotec2004,avelinoAcousticElectroglottographicAnalyses2010, chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010, campbellZenzontepecChatinoAspect2011,villardPhonologyMorphologyZacatepec2015, lopeznicolasEstudiosFonologiaGramatica2016}

\citet{chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010} describes the tone and phonation interactions in San Lucas Quiaviní Zapotec (SLQZ), a central valley variety of Zapotec. The distribution of tone and phonation is found in Table~\ref{tab:SLQZ}. We see that in SLQZ, both low- and falling-tones have the full range of possible combinations. However, we see gaps in the high-tone for breathy and rising tones that can only occur with modal phonation. 

\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\caption{SLQZ tone and phonation interactions \citep{chavez-peonInteractionMetricalStructure2010}.}
	\label{tab:SLQZ}
	 \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
	  \lsptoprule
					  &	 \textbf{Modal}  & \textbf{Breathy} & \textbf{Creaky} & \textbf{Interrupted} \\

		  Falling & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\
		  Rising & ✔︎ & -- & -- & -- \\
	  \lspbottomrule
	 \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Based on elicitation data collected from 2020-2022, SLZ has a more expansive distribution of tone and phonation when compared to SLQZ but seems to be very similar to other Northern Zapotec varieties \citep[e.g.,][]{avelinoTopicsYalalagZapotec2004}. The distribution of SLZ tonal and phonation combinations are given in Table~\ref{tab:ToneVoiceQuality}.
\begin{table}[!h]
	\caption{SLZ tone and voice quality combinations.}
	\label{tab:ToneVoiceQuality}
	\centering

	\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
	\lsptoprule
		& \textbf{Modal} & \textbf{Breathy} & \textbf{Checked} & \textbf{Rearticulated} \\
	\hline
	High		& ✔︎ & -- & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\
	Mid			& ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\
	Low			& ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\
	High-Low	& ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ & ✔︎ \\
	Mid-High	& ✔︎ & ✔︎ & -- & ✔︎ \\
	\lspbottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

One of the striking things in this is the lack of high tone with breathy phonation. This gap is interesting because of the long-time association of high pitch with breathiness \citep[for an overview, see][]{eslingVoiceQualityLaryngeal2019}. This gap is common across the Zapotecan languages that have breathy voice (Campbell p.c.). Regarding breathy phonation in SLQZ, one of the Valley Zapotec varieties, \citet{uchiharaToneRegistrogenesisQuiavini2016} offers some convincing evidence that the phonation originated in syllables with low tone and then spread to other tones via analogy. Investigating the origin of breathy voice in SLZ would be important in understanding how breathy vowels originated in the Zapotecan family where breathy voice is rare typologically \citep{ariza-garciaPhonationTypesTones2018}. Such a study is beyond the scope of this paper.
