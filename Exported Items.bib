  abstract = {Characteristics of glottal vibration are affected by the obstruction to the flow of air through the vocal tract system. The obstruction to the airflow is determined by the nature, location, and extent of constriction in the vocal tract during production of voiced sounds. The effects of constriction on glottal vibration are examined for six different categories of speech sounds having varying degree of constriction. The effects are examined in terms of source and system features derived from the speech and electroglottograph signals. It is observed that a high degree of constriction causing obstruction to the flow of air results in large changes in these features, relative to the adjacent steady vowel regions, as in the case of apical trill and alveolar fricative sounds. These changes are insignificant when the obstruction to the airflow is less, as in the case of velar fricative and lateral approximant sounds. There are no changes in the excitation features when there is a free flow of air along the auxiliary tract, despite constriction in the vocal tract, as in the case of nasals. These studies show that effects of constriction can indeed be observed in the features of glottal vibration as well as vocal tract resonances.},

  abstract = {Epoch is the instant of significant excitation of the vocal-tract system during production of speech. For most voiced speech, the most significant excitation takes place around the instant of glottal closure. Extraction of epochs from speech is a challenging task due to time-varying characteristics of the source and the system. Most epoch extraction methods attempt to remove the characteristics of the vocal-tract system, in order to emphasize the excitation characteristics in the residual. The performance of such methods depends critically on our ability to model the system. In this paper, we propose a method for epoch extraction which does not depend critically on characteristics of the time-varying vocal-tract system. The method exploits the nature of impulse-like excitation. The proposed zero resonance frequency filter output brings out the epoch locations with high accuracy and reliability. The performance of the method is demonstrated using CMU-Arctic database using the epoch information from the electroglottograph as reference. The proposed method performs significantly better than the other methods currently available for epoch extraction. The interesting part of the results is that the epoch extraction by the proposed method seems to be robust against degradations like white noise, babble, high-frequency channel, and vehicle noise.},
