# Dissertation Defense Outline

## Introduction

- **Overview of my dissertation**
	- **Research Questions**
		1. Is residual H1 an effective acoustic measure?
		2. How is the acoustic landscape structured for SLZ?
		3. Which measures are the most important in capturing and classifying the contrasts?
		4. How do these measures help explain the behavior of SLZ's laryngeal complexity?

## Previous Research

- **Measuring voice quality**
	- **Previous methods**
		- Fischer-Jørgensen (1968)
		- Gordon & Ladefoged (2001)
	- **Residual H1**
		- Chai & Garellek (2023)
		- Brinkerhoff & McGuire (2025)
- **Models of voice quality**
	- **Ladefogedian**
		- One-dimensional model: breathy to creaky
	- **Garellek et al. (2016)**
		- At least five dimensions
		- Psychoacoustic Model expands this to eight
		- Primarily differences between individual speakers
	- **Garellek et al. (2013) on White Hmong**
		- Fewer dimensions needed to capture phonation contrasts than speaker differences
	- **Keating et al. (2024)**
		- Cross-linguistic patterns collapse into two dimensions
- **Laryngeal Complexity**
	- What is laryngeal complexity?
	- Phasing
	- Implicational hierarchy of patterns
	- Previous research into laryngeal complexity:
		- Blankenship (1997, 2002)
		- Garellek & Keating (2011) on Jalapa Mazatec
		- Frazier on Yucatec Mayan
		- Dicanio on Triqui
		- Chichimec

## My Results

- **Data**
	- Fieldwork conducted with Maya in Summer 2022
- **Acoustic landscape**
	- **MDS**
		- Four dimensions used (based on scree plot)
		- Only three were informative
	- **MDS results**
		- 3D plot (consider as a GIF)
		- Dimension 1 × 2 plot
		- Dimension 1 × 3 plot
		- Dimension 2 × 3 plot
	- **Summary of MDS**
		- Dimensionality of the data:
			- Dimension 1: Glottal-airflow continuum
			- Dimension 2: Nonmodal-to-modal continuum
			- Dimension 3: Glottal-airflow continuum
- **Random Forest**
	- What is Random Forest?
	- Most important measures:
		- Duration
		- A1
		- H1-A1
		- Residual H1
		- HNR < 1500 Hz
		- SoE
	- Summary of Random Forest
- **Laryngeal Complexity in SLZ**
	- GAMMs
	- Measures considered:
		- f0
		- HNR
		- SoE
	- Summary of Results

## Overall Summary and Conclusions

- **Summary of results**
	- Acoustic landscape is structured by glottal airflow and nonmodal-to-modal phonation
	- Duration, A1, H1-A1, residual H1, HNR < 1500 Hz, and SoE are the most important measures for capturing the contrasts
	- Laryngeal complexity in SLZ produces vq weakly but also shows phasing between modal and nonmodal
